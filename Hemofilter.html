   <h3 style="padding: 15px">User Psychology</h3>
   <h4 style="padding: 20px">Desires</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Replace the functionality of the kidney</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Eliminate the need to undergo frequent dialysis treatments. Currently, people with kidney diseases or failure have to get dialysis up to three times a week for hours at a time.</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Enable users to have more independence than during traditional treatment methods (i.e., hemodialysis)</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Have a functioning filtration system within his or her body</li>

    <h4 style="padding: 20px">Constraints</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Device placement could inhibit user physical flexibility</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Device material must be accepted by the body</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Device machinery must be sophisticated and durable enough to continuously filter blood for six months</li>

     <h4 style="padding: 20px">Fears and Uncertainty</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Users may be apprehensive about putting a device into their bodies</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Users may be comfortable with the old system and not trust this new technology</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Users may fear situation of device malfunctioning</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Users may fear that it will dislodge or become contaminated (e.g., get caught on clothing, absorb water from showering, or be unclean)</li>

     <p style="padding: 15px">Note: Assuming that in 20-30 years (the projected timeline for this device), internal medical devices will be a more common practice and therefore users will be less afraid of using the device.</p>     

     <h4 style="padding: 20px">Doubt</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Being so different and less invasive than the traditional dialysis treatments, users may initially doubt the reliability of the system</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">The need for an implant</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Being in the medical field, it is likely that there will be some amount of doubt pertaining to any new form of treatment</li>

     <h4 style="padding: 20px">Aspirations</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Users live a normal life with Hemofilter</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Users do not worry about their kidney function</li>


  <h3 style="padding: 15px">Solution</h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px">Consistent with the model of hemodialysis, the Hemofilter removes the blood from the user, filters it outside the body, and then returns the blood back to the user’s bloodstream. However, Hemofilter differs from normal hemodialysis procedures in that the entire filtration system occurs within the inserted device rather than the machine shown in the image on the left below. Although the device is inserted in the cavity where the kidney previously resided, the procedure is still considered to occur outside the body because the device is inserted into a shell permanently embedded in the user’s skin, as shown in the image on the right. </p>
      <p style="padding: 15px">With significantly smaller machinery to filter the blood, the Hemofilter can be worn at all times while the user carries on with his or her daily schedule. Therefore, the Hemofilter is an example of biomimicry in that it closely resembles the kidney by continuously filtering blood at a slow rate. By mobilizing this blood filtration procedure, individuals who previously were held back by the need to undergo dialysis treatments (e.g., at least three times a week for about 4 hours per treatment) can have a much more active and fulfilling lifestyle.</p>     
      <p style="padding: 15px">Only needing to be replaced every six months, the Hemofilter requires minimal interaction from the user. Additionally, the simple nature of the Hemofilter is supported by the consistently simple design of the task analysis featured previously.</p>

  <h3 style="padding: 15px">Interactions</h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px">Similar to a kidney, the Hemofilter implant is meant to be a passive device. To do so, it will have only two modes, active and inactive. The “inactive” mode will allow for long term storage and will be switched to active mode by taking out a covering strip just before inserting the filter. This will be a irreversible process for sanitation reasons. </p>
      <p style="padding: 15px">The filter will be able to alert of failure by beeping. The device will be located in the back of the torso, thus, visual cues may be missed. Tactile modes are also not ideal as the device would need more power to accommodate this and thus, be larger and more invasive. Therefore, auditory feedback appears to be the best alert mode. Since failure of a kidney is a serious problem, the beeping noise will need to be loud and dealt with immediately under the supervision of a medical professional. The device can contact the doctor and be silenced under the appropriate conditions.</p>     
      <p style="padding: 15px">There will be no inputs. Different filter needs will be sorted before insertion. Similar to dosing of medications, different filters will be selected for different patients’ needs. The device will connect to the renal artery.</p>
      <p style="padding: 15px">Overall, the system will be interacted with in a minimal way, just as humans do not interact with their kidneys regularly.</p>

  <h3 style="padding: 15px">User Walkthrough</h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px">Craig Pelton (43) has been living with severely damaged kidneys for the past 8 months. He is on the waitlist for a donation, but it seems unlikely that he will be getting off that list any time soon. He lived with general discomfort in addition to his dialysis treatment. For months, Craig had to go to the hospital three times a week for 4 hours a day to get hemodialysis. This affected his ability to work, live a healthy lifestyle, and be a good father to his two daughters. </p>
      <p style="padding: 15px">Months ago, Craig received the Hemofilter implant by a doctor through a surgical procedure. Today, he no longer needs to visit the hospital every week. Once every six months, Craig gets a replacement cartridge from his doctor. When he needs to begin the replacement process, Craig deactivates the tamper-proof lock by holding two fingers on the existing cartridge and applying pressure for 5 seconds. The implant then releases its internal lock and the cartridge protrudes enough for it to be pulled out of the slot. After the cartridge is removed, it can be plugged into a computer that will upload patient diagnostics to a cloud system. Assuming that everything seems to be on-track, the replacement is inserted into the slot. The host locks the new cartridge in through the same process used for unlocking. </p>     
      <p style="padding: 15px">Because the Hemofilter implant acts similarly to a healthy kidney, Craig does not have to worry about the discomfort that his failing kidney used to give him. He is able to participate in the recreational activities such as coaching his daughter’s soccer team and going on long walks with his spouse. Other than meeting with his doctor two times a year, Craig is generally unaffected by his kidney damage.</p>

  <h3 style="padding: 15px">Discussion</h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px">he newest technology in this space is the AWAK (http://awak.com/), a transportable dialysis system carried in a messenger-type bag. Even though solutions such as AWAK now exist, the main difficulty in creating Hemofilter is how to reduce physical space required to conduct this blood filtration process even further. Just as computers have reduced in size from the first digital computer, known as the ENIAC and weighing nearly 50 tons, to the most recent Apple MacBook Air which weighs about 2.45 pounds, we believe this reduction is possible. Additionally, we will have to engineer how this system will exist inside the body rather than outside the body, as with current technology. We will require a sophisticated and diverse team of engineers to fully execute such a design. </p>
   
  <h3 style="padding: 15px">Future Directions + Limitations</h3>
      <p style="padding: 15px">If such an implant is able to work, it makes sense to see what other implants can be created to improve general health. This technology could be seen not only as a filtration or aid system, but also as a way we can provide nutrients to the rest of the body. For example, if a person is lactose intolerant, there could be a cartridge that contains the lactase enzyme that allows that person to digest lactose. This treatment could also be used to treat things like diabetes, malnutrition, and more. Most modern treatments that require frequent doctors visits for injections or dialysis-like operations could be improved through a cartridge-based implant.</p>
      <p style="padding: 15px">The most notable limitations of the Hemofilter include the feasibility of the cartridge-based system and user acceptance. Specifically, it is unclear whether the product would have the capability to conduct this filtration procedure in such a limited space. Additionally, when thinking about the frequent issues associated with kidney transplants, we do not know if there will be a solution that all bodies accept. Finally, users’ resistance to the technology may pose significant limitations to fully adopt this course of treatment as a viable option for kidney failure.</p>
