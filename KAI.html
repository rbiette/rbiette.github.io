    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">Product Brief</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">KAI is a discrete social robot to enhance and even replace psychological treatment (especially in remote areas and with people who cannot afford/get treatment for mental health issues). Using conversational artificial intelligence powered by machine learning using learning sets provided by trained psychiatric professionals, KAI is a semi-autonomous social robot that will help grow the number of patients that can be treated for their non-debilitating mental health issues in the US and across the world. </p>
   
    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">Background</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">1 in 5 Americans experience mental illness each year. Of those 20%, 56.4% of adults did not receive treatment (AMI, 2014). Barriers to getting help with mental illness include the social stigma of mental illness, prohibitive costs not covered by insurance, and lack of access to mental healthcare providers. In fact, 21.6% of adults with disabilities could not see a doctor for mental health issues because of cost. These patient-side issues are compounded by a dearth in mental healthcare professionals.</p>
    <p style="padding: 15px">Efforts have been taken to break down this stigma surrounding mental health. There has been some progress made, however a large number of people still do not seek treatment because of this stigma. Celebrities have spoken out about their struggles with mental health, which has helped lessen the harsh stereotypes associated with mental health. According to the CDC, suicide is one of the top ten causes of death for United States citizens ages 10 - 65.</p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">User Physicality</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">Mental health issues can affect people both mentally and physically. Depressed people may experience feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and other mental symptoms (“Mental Illness”, 2018). People with anxiety may become so worried about something that he or she can think of nothing else. Depending on the severity of the person’s illness, he or she may not be able to get out of bed, causing him/her to miss work, school, or other important engagements (Harvard Health Publishing, 2010). </p>
    <p style="padding: 15px">Hopefully at some point in peoples’ mental illnesses, they realize that they need help to cope with their mental illnesses, or have their mental illnesses recognized by their doctors. Once they realize they need help, they start working towards healthier life. They want to become more in control of their conditions and their lives. There are different ways to achieve this goal, but the person must be prepared to treat the underlying issues of their condition. With the correct strategies, a person can see improvement in their mental state and quality of life. Hopefully, they will be able to go back to living the life they did before their mental illness manifested. 
    </p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">User Psychology</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">With such a disruptive product in such a sensitive area, it is vital to fully understand the psychology of a potential user. </p>
    <p style="padding: 15px">A user in this situation desires someone (an unbiased third party) to talk to and be heard. They want to feel understood, but have their privacy respected. They also desire to get a better control over their mental illness and get back their life again or maybe even for the first time. Ultimately, a user aspires to break free of their illness and keep it away indefinitely. KAI will be successful when people do not need it anymore. A secondary user, such as a doctor, therapist, or family member, would desire that the user would be safe.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 15px">The user would be constrained in their life depending on their condition. However, KAI would be accessible wherever they need it. They could reach KAI by phone, text, or otherwise. If they were in a life threatening emergency, KAI would redirect them to the appropriate hotline. Other constraints of this solution include the cost of care to the user, the access to care by the user, and the technological capability of KAI.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 15px">Users would certainly have doubts about whether a robot could give them the help that they need. They might wonder if KAI is even listening, or worry if KAI is watching them. That is why trust is of the utmost importance in this system. KAI needs to build a unique connection with the user and emote in order to overcome the barrier of human-machine interaction. 
    </p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">Task Analysis</h3>   
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/kaiTask.png" alt="task analysis">

    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">Solution</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">WHAT KAI DOES: KAI is a conversational AI robot that has the ability to replace a human therapist with the goal of making mental health care more accessible.
    </p>    
    <p style="padding: 15px">WHAT KAI DOES: KAI will act like a real therapist. Once the user activates their session using the wake-phrase, KAI will be able to hold a conversation in the same way that a human would. This includes understanding tone and inflection, remembering details of the patient, being able to make connections between stories and symptoms. Essentially, if the user/patient were to close their eyes, they should be able to forget that they are not actually talking to a human therapist. Keep in mind, KAI is not meant to treat severe mental health disorders. For people who have debilitating disorders, a human therapist is still recommended. 
    </p>    
    <p style="padding: 15px">WHY: As mentioned earlier in this report, 1 in 5 American adults have a mental health disorder, and of those 20%, 56.4% did not receive any treatment. We believe that KAI will make mental health treatment more accessible, affordable, and common.
    </p>  


   <h3 style="padding: 15px">Specifications</h3>
   <h4 style="padding: 20px">Sensors</h4>
    <li style="padding-left: 30px">Microphone Array - Used to listen to user for wake phrase (always on like Echo or Google Home). Used to listen to user conversationally
    </li>
    <li style="padding-left: 30px">Camera + IR camera Visual Sensor Suite - The physical device is meant to look unassuming; when KAI is inactive, it could be mistaken for a mood lamp. Our team created this unassuming design to keep KAI unnoticed unless needed (see mockup)
    </li>
    <li style="padding-left: 30px">Wifi Antenna - IOT to connect to any wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit) to use heart rate information and actigraphy. This physical information can be used to supplement. 
    </li>
    <li style="padding-left: 30px">Touch Digitizer - KAI can detect and react to a user’s touch. The entire outer shell of KAI is touch-sensitive.
    </li>

    <h4 style="padding: 20px">Processors</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Conversational AI - Using supervised machine learning systems, KAI’s conversational AI is built to connect human speaking patterns to different mental health disorders. Using the collected disorder information and user information, KAI is able to talk the patient through their problems and recommend future coping strategies.</li>


     <h4 style="padding: 20px">Actuators/Effectors</h4>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Body/Head - The physical device is meant to look unassuming; when KAI is inactive, it could be mistaken for a mood lamp. Our team created this unassuming design to keep KAI unnoticed unless needed (see example)
</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Faces - KAI is built with a 360 degrees projector inside of the white outer shell. This allows the entire outer shell to act as a LED display. KAI can make a variety of emotional faces as well as do things like nod and shake its head because of the 360 degrees capability of the projector and shell design.
</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Haptic Actuator - Vibration motor is attached to the frame to respond physically to touch.</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">No wheels, arms, or limbs - KAI is designed to stay in one place, yet small enough to travel. Additionally, the lack of additional mechanical elements allows KAI to be visually unobtrusive. 
</li>
    

     <h4 style="padding: 20px">Emotive Displays</h4>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="img/kaiFace.png" alt="kaiFace">
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Facial expressions projected as LED lights on surface of orb from inside. When speaking: can nod, shake (head), wink/blink, mouth moves for smiling, talking, frowning.</li>
       <li style="padding-left: 30px"> When listening: Subtle nod and blink. Will react emotionally to what is being said </li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Reactions are linked to emotion type that is most empathetic and productive for the user. If a trained therapist would frown while talking about a sad subject with the patient, KAI will as well
      </li>


     <h4 style="padding: 20px">Interactions</h4>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="img/kaiGIF.gif" alt="kaiGIF">
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Voice and Text Interactions: companion application interaction for when not home/traveling, text summaries of interactions and things to work on/think about in coming days, touch interaction for breathing patterns, etc.</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Alerts: text notification, voice, vibration/haptic</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Voice/Text Input: Facial expression input can also be factored</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Different Modes - Session mode: dedicated treatment time OR Chat mode: quick check in 
</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Sleep Mode - not listening except for cue, respecting privacy of patient</li>







    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">User Walkthrough</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px"> In order for KAI to be useful to a user, the user will need to come to terms with their condition. This can come from self realization that something must be done or that someone wants to improve their mental health. It could also come as a recommendation by a doctor. Perhaps at a yearly physical, a doctor would suggest that the patient started to use KAI. Lastly, friends or family members could suggest that a user utilizes KAI. Ultimately, it comes down to the user. The user needs to want to change or else KAI will not be effective.
    </p>        
    <p style="padding: 15px"> Once the need for KAI is realized, the user will bring the device home. KAI will be placed in a setting where the user feels comfortable talking privately. The user would then run through the initial set up. KAI’s language, gender, and personality will be chosen. Part of this setup will involve an opt-out program for the KAI unit to be monitored by a real person such as a medical professional. This will enhance accountability. 
    </p>        
    <p style="padding: 15px"> The first session will begin when the user says the cue sentence, “Hi Kai, I am ready”.  The device will then wake up and learn about what issues the person is suffering from and what their goals are. If there is a diagnosis from a professional already, KAI will base treatment around that issue. Otherwise, KAI will approximate issues and double check with the human monitor. The session will conclude after an allotted amount of time expires or when the user chooses.
    </p> 
    <p style="padding: 15px"> After this first session, the user can summon KAI using the cue sentence. They can set reminders to talk with KAI at certain times, or just when they need it. KAI will build a rapport with the user through emoting based on the subject matter that the participant is talking about. The treatment will continue until the user or a medical professional decides it should be stopped. A user can talk with KAI for a long time like a therapy session, or just bounce issues off KAI quickly after a long day. KAI can help with meditation, identifying maladaptive thought patterns, or whatever the patient needs mentally. 
    </p> 

    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px">Future Directions + Limitations</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">   A main limitation of the KAI system is the technology necessary to make the system work. The AI and machine learning needed for KAI to understand the patient’s symptoms, make a diagnosis, and provide necessary treatment might not be advanced enough in the foreseeable future to make this technology possible. We will not develop KAI until the AI and machine learning technology have reached the level needed for KAI. 
    </p>        
    <p style="padding: 15px"> In the future, it may be beneficial to integrate KAI into less intrusive, more common systems, such as the Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or similar system. If KAI is integrated into one of these systems, use may increase because the physical robot would not be present in the user’s home. With the current system, a visitor could ask the user what KAI is, creating an awkward situation for the user. Many people know and understand what Alexa’s and Google Homes are at this point, so the user could have access to KAI without the hardware. 
    </p>        
    <p style="padding: 15px"> Another future hope is to build up the mental healthcare professionals workforce so users could eventually meet with a human therapist. Though we hope KAI is helpful in a user’s life, nothing can replace human contact and interaction. 
    </p>
