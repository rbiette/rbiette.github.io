What seperated this idea from the normal (GoogleMaps, Strava, etc.) is that the routes were crowdsourced and constantly changing to provide the safest and fastest routes for cyclists in the city.

            <p>In anticipation of the 2018 Boston Marathon, I designed a mobile app for the iPad. This project features heavy branding, with a subtle contemporary feel. This app is aimed at spectators who may be tracking just one runner or a team of runners perhaps from their workplace.

The design draws upon GE's clean lines and modern feel that was desired. A simple, crisp color scheme and typography choice was chosen.
