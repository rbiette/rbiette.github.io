    <h3 style="padding: 15px">Design Goal</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px"> Dispense personal pills accurately in a secure and efficient fashion with maximum automation </p>

    <h3 style="padding: 15px">Scope</h3>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Personal pill dispenser</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Only dispenses solid pills (no liquid medicine or special medication)</li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Will not alert the pharmacy directly when prescription is running low </li>
      <li style="padding-left: 30px">Will alert user when time to take medication and properly dispense medication</li>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px; padding-left:15px ">Task Flow</h3>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/TAflow.png" alt="flowchart" height="80%" width="80%">

    <p style="padding: 15px">This flow chart shows the task broken into steps. There are places for potential improvements such as error handling in scanning prescriptions. As this exercise was meant to prove the concept and not complete a working prototype, it is worthy to note these areas for potential improvement. But they are not within the scope of the project to actively address.</p>

   <h3 style="padding: 15px">Narrative Use Case</h3>
   <p style="padding: 15px">Anita, 76, has high blood pressure, seasonal allergies, and is on antibiotics for an ear infection. She has a Spenser: The Pill Dispenser at her home. Spenser automatically contacted her pharmacy of choice, so Anita was notified by her pharmacy that she had some Hygroton waiting for her. After she brings her pill bottle into her kitchen (where she keeps Spenser), she scans the label of the bottle. Anita presses the “input medicine” button. Spenser opens an input slot, scans the pill bottle information, and then automatically takes the pills in. Spenser thanks Anita and lists back the comments on her prescription such as "take twice a day with food and water".</p>

   <p style="padding-left: 15px"> The next morning at 8:30am (Anita's preset morning medication time), Spenser starts beeping and lighting up. Anita walks over to Spenser and it automatically scans her face. The alerts stop and the Zyrtec, Hygroton, and antibiotics are dispensed into a tray. Spenser reminds her that she should eat food and avoid alcohol. Anita takes her pills and carries on with the rest of her day. </p>

  <h3 style="padding: 15px">Other Aspects to Consider</h3>
  <h5 style="padding: 15px">Maintenance</h5>
  <li style="padding-left: 30px">Always plugged in</li>
  <li style="padding-left: 30px">Has back-up batteries for power outage cases </li>
  <li style="padding-left: 30px">If it breaks down, recovery mode is accessed by typing in a predetermined passcode (recommend using date of birth) on the back of the device.  Once typing this passcode in, the machine will go into recovery mode, where the device alerts the user of what pill prescription will be all given back to the user.  The user then puts their proper pill bottle under the machine to receive the prescription back in the bottle.</li>
  <li style="padding-left: 30px">User needs to refill their own prescriptions from the pharmacy and alert the pharmacy when they need a refill</li>
  <h5 style="padding: 15px">Generating Trust</h5>
  <p style="padding: 15px">We generated user trust through humanizing our machine and ensuring the safety of everyone using and living near Spenser. Though Spenser is a automated system, Spenser speaks to users in a colloquial tone rather than just displaying information on a screen or speaking in a robotic voice. Even the name Spenser invokes thoughts of a person.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 15px">Trust also comes from security. Spenser uses facial recognition software as a security measure, so the person whose face is entered in the system can receive pills. If needed, trusted caretakers can also access pills using a preset passcode. Spenser securely stores medication so there is no risk of children accessing and ingesting pills accidentally.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 15px">Naive User Walk-Through: Jane, a 12 year old child, is visiting her grandmother for the weekend.  Her grandmother takes quite a few medications for her arthritis and high blood pressure.  While Jane is baking brownies in the kitchen, her grandmother has stepped outside to talk to the gardner.  She hears a small beeping noise in the background - it is her grandmother’s Spenser.  Her grandma had told her if she heard that noise while she was out to retrieve her medication and keep it in the tray.  So Jane makes her way over to Spenser.  She thinks at first it will immediately dispense and taps on the touch screen.  Instead, nothing happens but a prompt for a passcode appears.  It asks for Date of Birth.  She thinks to herself and types in her grandmother’s medication.  Then one pill dispenses and she hears the description read out.  Then another pill dispenses and the same series occurs.  Jane picks up the tray like her grandmother told her.  Spenser reports those are the only pills at the time and then the display screen goes blank.  Jane tries tapping on the screen and it only reports it is locked.  There is no prompt for any passcode no matter how many times she taps.  Jane puts the tray down next to the system and walks away.  When her grandmother returns, Jane tells her about the medication being ready.  Her grandmother takes her pills, and they continue to make their brownies!</p>

    <h3 style="padding: 15px">Conclusions</h3>
    <p style="padding: 15px">Through this exercise with hierarchical task analysis, our group was able to create a system plan for an automated pill dispensing machine. Starting with identifying our target users, and delving into our research on medication management, we sought to think of as many edge cases that Spenser could be put through. With a limited time frame, the project did not go any further, but we believe that it does have the potential to become a reality and expand upon the ideas we have put forth. </p>
